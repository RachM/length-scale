calculateCorrelationWithERT.m:
  - Script for calculating the correlation between each metric and the best ERT

calculateDistributionsAndKL.m:
  - Script for calculating the length scale distributions and KL divergence

calculateDistributionsAndKLBetweenD.m:
  - Calculates the length scale distributions and KL divergence between BBOB problems of different dimensions

calculateMetrics.m:
  - Script for calculating landscape metrics of the BBOB problems

plotDistributionsBetweenD.m:
  - Script for plotting the length scale distributions across dimensionality
  
plotDjResults.m:
  - Script for plotting the J-divergence visualisations, heatmaps and dendrograms

plotFeatureVectorSpace.m:
